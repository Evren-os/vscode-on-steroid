# VSCode on Steroid

This is my personal Visual Studio Code setup for a distraction-free and seamless coding environment with a Vim-like appearance.

## Main Features

Although this setup mimics a Vim-like look, it doesn't use any Vim keybindings. It utilizes the default VSCode keybindings with some customizations. I also tweaked the theme for more darker and staurated look.

- **Hidden UI Elements**: 
  - **Activity Bar**: Toggle on/off with `Ctrl + Alt + A` (set keymap manually) 
  - **Menu Bar**: Toggle on/off with `Alt`
  - **Status Bar**: Hidden for a cleaner interface
